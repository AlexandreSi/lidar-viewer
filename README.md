# lidar-viewer

This project aims at exposing code to develop a web-based lidar viewer.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is based on [`three.js`](https://threejs.org/), more specifically [`three-full`](https://github.com/Itee/three-full).

# How to

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:AlexandreSi/lidar-viewer.git && cd lidar-viewer
```

Note: It might take time as it downloads the `.las` file as well.

Then install the node modules:

```bash
yarn install
```

Finally, launch the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

And navigate to http://localhost:3000/!
